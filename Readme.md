# Adhesion of membranes with competing specific and generic interactions

This is a talk I gave for the Seminar on *Systems Biology of Immunology* at the [Applied Systems Biology group](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/applied-systems-biology.html).
I presented a paper by T. R. Weikl *et al.* which you can find [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epje/i2002-10008-2).

To use the presentation notebook interactively, you will need to have the Julia package [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) installed.
Static (non-interactive) versions as HTML and PDF, as well as the handout can be found at the releases.
